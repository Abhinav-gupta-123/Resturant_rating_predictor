📌 A Machine Learning-based project to predict restaurant ratings based on various features.


This project is part of the Cognifyz Internship Program, where the task was to build a restaurant rating prediction model using machine learning. The dataset was provided by Cognifyz, and the objective was to train a model to predict ratings accurately based on key restaurant parameters.

🚀 Workflow


⿡ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊


🔹 Understanding the dataset


🔹 Generating insights and patterns


🔹 Visualizing key relationships



⿢ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering 🔧


🔹 Handling missing values


🔹 Encoding categorical features


🔹 Feature selection and extraction



⿣ Model Development & Optimization 🤖


🔹 Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets


🔹 Testing multiple classification models


🔹 Hyperparameter tuning (Accuracy improved from 63% → 85% 🚀)



⿤ Deployment with Streamlit 🌐


🔹 Building an interactive UI with Streamlit


🔹 Allowing users to input restaurant details & get predicted ratings



📊 Dataset Details


The dataset includes various restaurant-related attributes such as:


✅ Table Booking Availability (Yes/No)


✅ Online Delivery Option (Yes/No)


✅ Average Cost for Two People (Numerical)


✅ Cuisines Offered (Text)


✅ Price Range (Categorical)


✅ Number of Votes Received (Numerical)
